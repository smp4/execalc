# Development

## Environments

Activate one of the non-default environments with `hatch`.

```console
hatch -e docs shell
```

## Formats

> Notebooks with Markdown can be read in, executed, and cached by Jupyter Book (see Execute and cache your pages for information on how to cache pages). This allows you to store all of your notebook content in a text format that is much nicer for version control software, while still having all the functionality of a Jupyter notebook.

Use markdown for everything

## Cruft

template variables

* user chooses python version. limit to only one python for everythign, since a jupyter notebook can only hve one kernel per notebook
*
